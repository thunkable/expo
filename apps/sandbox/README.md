This is a blank app that is set up with yarn workspaces to use the local working copies of expo-sdk and all of the universal modules.

Use this sandbox app when you need to quickly test something you're developing locally. Everything in this folder other than the already committed files is ignored. You'll need to add an App.js file locally in order to use this sandbox -- easiest is to just copy the one from the blank project template.
