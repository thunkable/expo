/**
 * A simple, asynchronous, persistent, key-value storage system designed as a
 * backend to the AsyncStorage JS module, which is modeled after LocalStorage.
 *
 * Current implementation stores small values in serialized dictionary and
 * larger values in separate files. Since we use a serial file queue
 * `RKFileQueue`, reading/writing from multiple threads should be perceived as
 * being atomic, unless someone bypasses the `ABI32_0_0RCTAsyncLocalStorage` API.
 *
 * Keys and values must always be strings or an error is returned.
