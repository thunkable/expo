title: Haptic
---

Provides haptic feedback for iOS 10+ devices using the Taptic Engine.

> If this is used in Android the device will use `ReactNative.Vibrate` instead, it's best to just avoid this.

**The Taptic engine will do nothing given the following circumstances:**
* Low Power Mode is enabled
  * [Feature Request](https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/expose-low-power-mode-ios-battery-saver-android)
* User disabled the Taptic Engine in settings
  * [Feature Request](https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/react-native-settings)
* Haptic engine generation is to low (less than 2nd gen) - Private API
  * Using private API will get your app rejected: `[[UIDevice currentDevice] valueForKey: @"_feedbackSupportLevel"]` so this is not added in Expo
* iOS version is less than 10 (iPhone 7 is the first phone to support this)
  * This could be found through: `Expo.Constants.platform.ios.systemVersion` or `Expo.Constants.platform.ios.platform`
