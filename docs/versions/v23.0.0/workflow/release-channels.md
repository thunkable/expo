title: Release Channels
---

> **WARNING:** Channel features are in beta.

## Introduction

Use release channels in Expo to send out different versions of your application to your users by giving them a URL or configuring your standalone app. You should use release channels if:
- You have an app in production and need a testing environment.
- You have multiple versions of your app.

## Publish with Channels

Publish your release by running:

`exp publish --release-channel <your-channel>`

with the `exp` cli. Your users can see this release in the Expo client app with a parameterized URL `https://exp.host/@username/yourApp?release-channel=<your-channel>`. If you do not specify a channel, you will publish to the `default` channel.

## Build with Channels

Build your standalone app by running

`exp build:ios --release-channel <your-channel>`

`exp build:android --release-channel <your-channel>`

with the `exp` cli. The binary produced will only pull releases published under the specified channel. If you do not specify a channel, your binary will pull releases from the `default` channel.

## Get Channels

 You can access the channel your release is published under with the `releaseChannel` field in the [manifest object](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/constants.html#expoconstantsmanifest).

## Example Workflow

Consider a situation where you have a Staging stack for testing on Expo Client, and a Production stack for pushing through TestFlight, then promoting to the AppStore.

On the staging stack, run `exp publish --release-channel staging`. Your test users can see the staging version of your app by specifying the channel in the query parameter of the URL (ie)`https://exp.host/@username/yourApp?release-channel=staging`, then opening the URL in their web browser, and finally scanning the QR code with the Expo client. Alternatively, they can open that URL directly on their mobile device.

On the production stack, release v1 of your app by running `exp publish --release-channel prod-v1`. You can build this version of your app into a standalone ipa by running `exp build:ios --release-channel prod-v1`. You can push updates to your app by publishing to the `prod-v1` channel. The standalone app will update with the most recent compatible version of your app on the `prod-v1` channel.

If you have a new version that you dont want v1 users getting, release v2 of your app by running `exp publish --release-channel prod-v2` and building it with `exp build:ios --release-channel prod-v2`. Users with the `prod-v2` ipa will only be pulling releases from that channel.

You can continue updating v1 of your app with `exp publish --release-channel prod-v1`, and users who havent updated to the latest `prod-v2` ipa in the Apple App Store will continue receiving the latest `prod-v1` releases.
