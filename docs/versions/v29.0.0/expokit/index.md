title: ExpoKit
---

ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or `react-native init`.

Because Expo already provides the ability to [render native binaries for the App Store](../distribution/building-standalone-apps), most Expo developers do not need to use ExpoKit. In some cases, projects need to make use of third-party Objective-C or Java native code that is not included in the core Expo SDK. ExpoKit provides this ability.

This documentation will discuss:

- [Detaching](detach) your normal (JS) Expo project into a JS-and-native ExpoKit project
- [Changing your workflow](expokit) to use custom native code with ExpoKit
