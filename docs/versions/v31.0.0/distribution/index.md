title: Distributing Your App
---

Distributing your app to your users is a critical process in the development of any product. This documentation will cover topics related to app distribution, such as how to:

- [Create native builds](../guides/building-standalone-apps.html) you can submit to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store
- Prepare your app for [deployment to the App Store and Play Store](../guides/app-stores.html) and avoid common rejections.
- Manage different [release environments](../guides/release-channels.html) for your app
